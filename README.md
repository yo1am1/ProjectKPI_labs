KPI: “Programming 1”/"Programming 2" labs. Oriechov – 10 points. 


Disclaimer: some files in this project might be comparatively bad as a result of creating it after learning the basics (I am lazy and don't wanna rewrite them),
so it may not satisfy your desires. Please consider redoing labs to avoid duplicates and unpleasant incidents. 

Thank you for your understanding, have fun)
