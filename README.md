# ProjectKPI. Labs. First year

> KPI Kyiv Ukraine: “Programming 1”/"Programming 2" labs. 10 points. 


## Disclaimer: ***The project was created for educational purposes. I am not responsible for the usage of this code.***
<sub> Also, some files in this project might be comparatively bad as a result of creating it after learning the basics and adding extra stuff just for fun (I am lazy and don't wanna rewrite them), so it may not be very good if you already know what you are doing. </sub>


**I strongly recommend considering ***redoing labs by YOURSELF to learn and not just copy-paste***. You should avoid duplicates and unpleasant incidents!
I appreciate your understanding, may the force be with you, and have fun:grin:**
