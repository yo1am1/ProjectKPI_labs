KPI Kyiv Ukraine: “Programming 1”/"Programming 2" labs. 10 points. 


Disclaimer: The project was created for educational purposes. I am not responsible for the usage of this code and strongly recommend doing labs by yourself. 
Also some files in this project might be comparatively bad as a result of creating it after learning the basics and adding extra stuff just for fun (I am lazy and don't wanna rewrite them), so it may not be very good if you already know what you are doing. Please consider redoing labs to avoid duplicates and unpleasant incidents

Thank you for your understanding, may the force be with you, and have fun)
