KPI Kyiv Ukraine: “Programming 1”/"Programming 2" labs. Oriechov – 10 points. 


Disclaimer: some files in this project might be comparatively bad as a result of creating it after learning the basics (I am lazy and don't wanna rewrite them),
so it may not satisfy your desires. Please consider redoing labs to avoid duplicates and unpleasant incidents. Also I added interesting stuff while practising 
what I learned before, so you can just copy the part you need.

Thank you for your understanding, may the force be with you, have fun)
